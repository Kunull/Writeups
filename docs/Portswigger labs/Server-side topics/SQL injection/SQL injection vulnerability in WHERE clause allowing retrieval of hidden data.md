Let's filter by `Accessories`.

The resultant SQL query is:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Accessories' AND released = 1
```

 Since we are proxying the traffic through Burp Suite, we can access this request in the `Proxy> HTTP History` tab.

Let's forward this request to the `Repeater` for further modification.

Once in the `Repeater`, we can set the `categories` filter to the following:

```
' OR '1'='1'--
```

The resultant SQL query will be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' OR '1' = '1'--' AND released = 1
```

Since 1 is always equal to 1, the server will output all the categories. And since, we are commenting out the `AND released = 1` part, even the unreleased products will be output.

We have solved the lab.
